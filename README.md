# Data recovery game

This project is a game, called “data recovery”.
The game takes from user a path to a text file and corruption rate (how “damaged” user wants their text to be)
The point of the game is to examine all of the corrupted symbols and recover text using the least possible amount of moves.

## **Important**
**user’s text file (.txt) requirements:**
1.	Must contain one line
2.	File encoding has to be ANSI or program won’t be able to read your text

I am adding some text files that were used for testing, so you can try them yourself too.
